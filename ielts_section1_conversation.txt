RECEPTIONIST: Good morning, Riverside Swimming Centre. This is Sarah speaking. How can I help you?

CALLER: Oh hello. I'm calling about swimming lessons for my daughter. I saw your advertisement in the local newspaper.

RECEPTIONIST: Certainly! I'd be happy to help you with that. Could I start by taking some details? What's your daughter's name, please?

CALLER: It's Emma. That's E-M-M-A. And her surname is Johnson - J-O-H-N-S-O-N.

RECEPTIONIST: Thank you. And how old is Emma?

CALLER: She's eight years old. She'll be nine next month, but she's eight now.

RECEPTIONIST: Right, so she'll be in our junior group then. And what's your contact number in case we need to reach you?

CALLER: It's 07956 483729. That's my mobile number.

RECEPTIONIST: Let me just confirm that - 07956 483729. Perfect. And could I have your address please?

CALLER: Yes, we live at 45 Park Avenue. That's in Millfield.

RECEPTIONIST: Park Avenue in Millfield. And what's the postcode?

CALLER: MF3 7RQ.

RECEPTIONIST: Excellent. Now, what's Emma's current swimming level? Has she had any lessons before?

CALLER: Well, she can swim a little bit. She can do basic front crawl for about 10 metres, but her technique isn't very good. I'd say she's a beginner really.

RECEPTIONIST: That sounds like our Level 2 class would be perfect for her. The Level 1 is for complete beginners who can't swim at all, and Level 2 focuses on improving basic strokes.

CALLER: That sounds ideal. When are the classes held?

RECEPTIONIST: We have several options. There's a Wednesday evening class at 6:30, a Saturday morning class at 10:00, and a Sunday afternoon class at 2:15.

CALLER: The Saturday morning sounds good. What time does it finish?

RECEPTIONIST: The Saturday class runs from 10:00 to 11:00, so it's a one-hour session.

CALLER: Perfect. And how much does it cost?

RECEPTIONIST: The lessons are £15 per session, or you can buy a block of 8 lessons for £110. That works out slightly cheaper.

CALLER: I think I'll start with the block of 8 lessons then. When can she start?

RECEPTIONIST: The next course starts this Saturday, the 16th of March. Would that suit you?

CALLER: Yes, that's fine. What should she bring?

RECEPTIONIST: She'll need a swimming costume, towel, and goggles. We also recommend bringing a water bottle. Oh, and parents aren't allowed in the pool area during lessons for safety reasons, but you can watch from the viewing gallery.

CALLER: That's understandable. Is there parking available?

RECEPTIONIST: Yes, we have a car park right next to the building. It's free for customers.

RECEPTIONIST: Right, let me just confirm the booking. That's Emma Johnson, aged 8, Level 2 swimming lessons, Saturday mornings at 10:00, starting March 16th, block of 8 lessons for £110. Is that correct?

CALLER: Yes, that's perfect.

RECEPTIONIST: Great! How would you like to pay? We accept cash, card, or bank transfer.

CALLER: I'll pay by card when I come in on Saturday.

RECEPTIONIST: That's fine. Just arrive about 15 minutes early on Saturday for Emma to get changed. The changing rooms are on the ground floor.

CALLER: Wonderful. Is there anything else I need to know?

RECEPTIONIST: Just that if Emma misses a lesson, we can arrange a make-up session, but you need to give us at least 24 hours notice. And if you have any questions, just give us a call.

CALLER: That's great. Thank you so much for your help, Sarah.

RECEPTIONIST: You're very welcome! We look forward to seeing Emma on Saturday. Have a lovely day!

CALLER: Thank you. Goodbye!

RECEPTIONIST: Goodbye!
