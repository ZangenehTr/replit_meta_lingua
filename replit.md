# Meta Lingua Platform

## Overview
Meta Lingua is an AI-enhanced multilingual language learning and institute management platform. Its purpose is to provide a robust, self-contained solution for language institutes globally, enabling effective language education in any language and efficient institute operations. The platform is designed to be self-hostable and independent of services blocked in certain regions, catering to teaching ALL languages. Key capabilities include a comprehensive admin system, student management, course enrollment, VoIP integration, and a wallet-based payment system.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Work sessions: User prefers to have work logged so they can resume from where we left off.
Critical requirement: Self-hosting in Iran with zero external dependencies. Must follow check-first protocol.
Database strategy: Use Replit/Neon for development only, migrate to self-hosted PostgreSQL for production in Iran.
Code quality: Always avoid duplications - no duplicate code, methods, or logic. Prefer composition and reuse over duplication.
Language preference: Default language set to Farsi (fa) for Iranian users.
CRITICAL DIRECTIVE: 3-day deadline to achieve 100% functionality - NO hardcoded data, NO fake/mock data, NO non-functional buttons, NO duplications, comprehensive tests required, replace OpenAI with Ollama (user's server).
