Before making any changes to the application follow these two steps:
1: run a first-check protocol to avoid duplications
2: never use mock data or fake information
After any changes run a test to make sure all features and buttons correctly function.
Never forget the 3 instructions I as the project lead gave you till the end of meta lingua project
13 Bugs detected after deployment
1: the voip center button in lead management disappeared!
2: in Student Information System the call button for students show error
3: although the language is selected as English, this page is farsi!https://meta-lingua.replit.app/callcenter/leads
4: prospects page should be dedicated to students who call us for come classes but at that time we do not offer them but in the future we would. For example one is looking for free discussion , one is looking for are verbal-writing skills, one is looking for advanced conversation. Here we should archive them and when such a class is dreated, automatically those prospects who match the course or class must be sms texted, 24 hours later push notification send, and 48 hours later call center agents must be notified to call the selected students who match the class or course.
5:this website builder does not work at all, nothing there functions properly. Everything ia probably mock or fake buttons and data with no functionality. I need a comprehensive easy to use responsive SEO-optimised website builder which must act as somewhere to present and show the current classes and students must be able to make online payment there.
6: campaign management is trash! Again nothing works at all. This section was supposed to have 360 degree digital marketing tools for social media automatic upload/reply , telegram automatic content uploader in our channels and groups separately and reply the questions which students ask in the groups using fine-tuned ai we have installed on the application used universally. Campaign management must be able to send emails to all email addresses students have.
7: in teacher management we define each teacher’s rate/payment but in calculating the teachers payment these rates are not used and asked for a flat rate on teachers payment for all teacher which is wrong. The payments should rely on the rate per hour defined in teacher management. Supervisors should also have access to students payment because they normally approve the payments. Teachers in callern should be paid according to their rate and hours they worked as callern teacher. It is possible a teacher might work as a normal teacher with a different rate payment from his role as a callern standby teacher. So for those who work in the two departments, this should be shown in their pay roll.
8: in course management we only have callern packages management and other courses: in-person, online, video-based are not clearly provided. We also have two pricing features on on callern config page on in price tab there. 
9: in user management section I should be able to modify each role’s accessibility to application areas and features
10:as soon as creating a new user, the user name and password and entry link should be sent to her. Actually I must be able to change the text in template section
11:sms templates have no visible id number 
12: throughout the application there are many inconsistencies in the app language. There are examples that although the language is selected as English, some pages or even some boxed show farsi words or numbers. Correct two language mode and remove ALL hardcodes and replace with correct translation. This is vital.
13:game management is so weird! I want  you to design one comprehensive game for vocabulary  covering A1 to C2 words. Each step of the game should involve different skill like spelling, pronunciation, guessing the name of an object based on a photo and guessing the word based on a riddle format. This game must be created from a to z by you. This game should have leader board and even two students should be able to challenge each other. Online students should be seen there and if one student clicks on one of them, a request is sent to that person, if accepted the challenge starts.
14: class scheduling should have registration start date, class start date, class end date which must be automatically based on the calendar and days and hours which are needed to be added in class management. All these classed should have an option of showing in the website or not tick box. If checked yes show it on the website, they must be shown on the website in a table which students can pay and register. 
15: in teacher management, there should be a phot box . When students like on the name of the teacher everywhere, they should be able to see his photo and his qualifications only. No phone number or email must be shown. Students must be also able to score teachers and the score must be shown next to teachers name. Only real students of a certain teacher can score him/her.
