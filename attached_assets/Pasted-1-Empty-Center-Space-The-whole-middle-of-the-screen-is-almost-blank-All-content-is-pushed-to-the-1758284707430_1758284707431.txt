1. Empty Center Space

The whole middle of the screen is almost blank.

All content is pushed to the far left (sidebar) and far right (permissions card).
👉 Issue: Feels unbalanced and wastes valuable space.

2. Card Alignment Problems

The Subsystem Permissions card is floating on the right, not aligned with the content flow.

Below it, the Select Role to Configure card is squished, with labels overlapping.
👉 Issue: Inconsistent layout → breaks hierarchy and readability.

3. Overlapping / Cut-off Text

In the “Select Role to Configure” section, the role names (“Administrator, User, Callern, Teacher…”) are overlapping or cut off.
👉 Issue: Hard to read and unprofessional. Likely a flexbox/grid spacing bug.

4. Icon / Label Spacing in Sidebar

Sidebar icons are a good idea, but spacing is inconsistent:

Some items (like “کنترل دسترسی بازی‌ها”) take two lines and break alignment.

Others are short and centered.
👉 Issue: Uneven line-heights → sidebar looks messy.

5. Language Mixing

Sidebar mixes English + Persian (e.g., “Games Management” vs. “کنترل دسترسی بازی‌ها”).
👉 Issue: Unless intentional, mixing languages feels inconsistent. Better to provide a language toggle instead.

6. Hierarchy Confusion

The top “Subsystem Permissions” card has bold design, but the more interactive section (“Select Role to Configure”) looks smaller and secondary.
👉 Issue: Wrong visual hierarchy — the interactive element should stand out more.

7. Color Usage

The purple gradient card is very strong, while the rest of the UI is plain white.
👉 Issue: Unbalanced — one element steals attention, the rest feels neglected.

8. Responsiveness

Judging from the layout, this design may not scale well to smaller screens. The right-hand card could get cut off.
👉 Issue: Not mobile/tablet friendly unless restructured.

✅ Suggestions to Fix

Balance Layout: Center content or use a 2-column layout (Sidebar + Main Content).

Fix Role List: Use grid or scrollable tabs for roles so names don’t overlap.

Consistent Language: Add a language toggle (English ↔ Persian).

Visual Hierarchy: Make “Select Role” section the primary focus, with stronger card style.

Whitespace: Reduce empty middle gap by widening cards or centralizing content.

Sidebar polish: Fix spacing so all items align nicely, even with mixed-length labels.

Responsive design: Ensure cards stack vertically on smaller screens.

👉 In short: the UI has good building blocks, but suffers from imbalanced layout, poor spacing, overlapping text, and inconsistent hierarchy.
