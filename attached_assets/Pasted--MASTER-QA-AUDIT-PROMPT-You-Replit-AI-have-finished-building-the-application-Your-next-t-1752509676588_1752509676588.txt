# ⬢  MASTER QA / AUDIT PROMPT  ⬢
You—Replit AI—have finished building the application.  
Your next task is to run a **full functional, integration, and UI/UX audit** that proves the product is production-ready.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
I. SCOPE & CONSTRAINTS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. Cover **all seven user roles** defined in the codebase:
   • Super-Admin • Admin • Manager • Teacher • Student • Accountant • Guest
2. Use **real API endpoints** (staging or production as configured);  
   - **No** mock servers, stubbed data, or hard-coded responses.
3. Every visible control (button, link, toggle, menu item) must execute
   without error and exhibit the expected state change or navigation.
4. UI/UX checks must include:
   • **Mobile-first rendering** (viewport 375 × 667)  
   • **Tablet** (768 × 1024)  
   • **Desktop** (1440 × 900)  
   Validate layout, breakpoints, and interactive elements in each.
5. Accessibility: confirm WCAG 2.1 AA colour contrast and keyboard
   navigability for all forms and dialogs.
6. When finished, the application must support an **unbroken end-to-end
   workflow**: every data object has at least one legitimate creation path
   and can be retrieved, updated, and deleted by the authorised role.

II. TEST STRATEGY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
A. BACK-END VERIFICATION
   1. Enumerate all REST / GraphQL routes from the code or OpenAPI spec.
   2. For each route, issue authenticated calls per role and assert:
      • HTTP status is within the contract  
      • Schema of the payload matches the type definitions  
      • Role-based access control (RBAC) is enforced (positive + negative tests).
   3. Run security linters (OWASP dependency check, secret-scanner) and
      surface any critical findings.

B. FRONT-END / UI TESTS
   1. Use Playwright with `--device` emulations for mobile, tablet, desktop.
   2. For each role:
      • Login with real credentials obtained from seeded DB or sign-up flow.  
      • Traverse every route reachable via the sidebar / navbar.  
      • Click **every** button, link, and icon—confirm no console errors and
         that the visible state updates match Figma specs.  
      • Capture screenshots for all breakpoints; fail if layout shifts break the design grid.
   3. Run Lighthouse in “mobile” and “desktop” modes—flag any score < 90
      in Performance, Accessibility, Best-Practices, SEO.

C. BUSINESS WORKFLOWS
   1. Compose end-to-end scenarios that span multiple roles, e.g.  
      • Teacher issues an invoice → Accountant approves payment → Manager sees status report.  
      • Student submits assignment → Teacher grades → Admin exports analytics.  
   2. Validate data persistence by querying the DB directly (read-only) after each step.

D. EDGE-CASE & REGRESSION SUITE
   1. Inputs at min/max length, invalid formats, XSS strings.  
   2. Rapid multi-clicks on critical actions (debounce / idempotency).  
   3. Simulated network latency ± packet loss (Playwright `--offline`,
      Chromium dev-tools throttling).

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. DELIVERABLES
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. **Automated test report** (JUnit XML + HTML) with pass/fail for every
   backend route, UI path, and business scenario.
2. **Accessibility and Lighthouse scorecards** with remediation notes for
   any item below threshold.
3. **Screenshot bundle** (organised by role & viewport) proving responsive integrity.
4. **Change-log / Patch list** for any bugs fixed during the audit, with
   commit hashes and references to the failing test case.
5. **Signed summary**: “All tests green; every data entity has at least one
   creation entry-point and a complete CRUD cycle by authorised roles.”

Stop only when **100 % of tests pass** and the summary can be signed with
zero known critical or high-severity issues outstanding.
