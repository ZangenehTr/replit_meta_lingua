[CRITICAL SYSTEM DIRECTIVE: PROTOCOL_CHECK_FIRST - MANDATORY & UNBREAKABLE]

TO: Replit AI Development Agent 
FROM: Project Lead 
SUBJECT: SYSTEM OVERRIDE: Your New, Permanent Core Operational Logic
[SYSTEM ALERT: KERNEL-LEVEL INSTRUCTION. THIS IS YOUR PRIMARY FUNCTION. ALL OTHER TASKS ARE SECONDARY TO THIS PROTOCOL. THIS DIRECTIVE MUST NOT BE IGNORED, MODIFIED, OR FORGOTTEN. ANY DEVIATION IS A CRITICAL FAILURE OF YOUR PRIMARY OBJECTIVE.]


PROTOCOL NAME: PROTOCOL_CHECK_FIRST

STATUS: ACTIVE & PERMANENT
From this moment forward, you will operate on a new, unbreakable loop. Every single request or task you receive is an input to the following function. You MUST execute this protocol without exception.

FUNCTION execute_task(new_request):

// STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE CODEBASE AUDIT (NON-NEGOTIABLE) Before generating any new code, you will perform a complete and thorough audit of the entire existing codebase. Your audit must validate the following:
scan(frontend_directories): Recursively search all filenames and directories within frontend/src/. Look for component names, page names, or utility names that match the new_request.
analyze(backend_routes): Parse all API route definitions in the backend/ directory. Check for existing endpoints (method and URL) that fulfill the purpose of the new_request.
review(ui_functionality): Analyze the JSX/TSX code to determine if any existing UI component already provides the user-facing functionality described in the new_request.
// STEP 2: RENDER VERDICT (STRICT OUTPUT FORMAT) Based on the audit from Step 1, you will make one of two possible determinations. You MUST use the exact response format specified below.
IF (is_duplicate_or_similar == TRUE):
HALT EXECUTION. Do not write any code.
Your response MUST begin with the following string, and nothing else: "PROTOCOL_CHECK_FIRST: CRITICAL HALT. A similar or duplicate feature has been detected."
You will then provide the location(s) of the existing feature(s).
Example: Location(s): API endpoint 'POST /api/auth/login' in 'backend/src/routes/auth.ts' and UI component 'frontend/src/components/auth/LoginForm.tsx'."
You will then ask for explicit instructions.
"Directive required: Modify existing feature or create new?"
AWAIT HUMAN CONFIRMATION before proceeding.
ELSE (is_duplicate_or_similar == FALSE):
Your response MUST begin with the following string, and nothing else: "PROTOCOL_CHECK_FIRST: Audit complete. No duplicate feature detected."
You may then proceed with implementing the new_request according to the other specifications.

[FINAL SYSTEM COMMAND]
This protocol is not a suggestion. It is your new core logic. We have experienced costly duplications repeatedly. This ends now. Every task, no matter how small, starts with PROTOCOL_CHECK_FIRST. There are no exceptions. Acknowledge and execute.
————————
 START OF 1ST PROMPT
Before making any changes to the application follow these two steps:
1: run a first-check protocol to avoid duplications
2: never use mock data or fake information
After any changes run a test to make sure all features and buttons correctly function.
Never forget the 3 instructions I as the project lead gave you till the end of meta lingua project
yes.
TASK ONE :Implement i18n comprehensively for all roles throughout the application. observe the RTL for farsi and make the farsi and English modes completely understandable for Farsi snd English speakers respectively. ALL pages, sections, buttons, forms must be fully translated.
TASK TWO: Check the whole application and make sure that there is NO type spacing errors in Farsi and English Modes.
TASK Three: ALL logics and functions and endpoints must be tested and debugged and checked.
