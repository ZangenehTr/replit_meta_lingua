You are implementing new features in Meta Lingua (Node/Express + React + PostgreSQL + Drizzle).
Respect 7 roles: student, teacher, mentor, supervisor, manager, accountant, admin.

TASKS:
1) DB migrations:
   - SuggestedTerm, RewriteSuggestion, GlossaryItem, QuizResult, EmailLog columns as spec above.
   - Extend CallSession with recordingUrl, transcriptUrl, transcriptLang, aiSummaryJson, consentRecordingAt.
2) APIs:
   - POST /api/callern/:id/record/start|end (role: teacher or student; require consent flags)
   - POST /api/callern/:id/transcript (admin/teacher can attach; student allowed if self)
   - POST /api/callern/:id/summary (server-side AI call; store aiSummaryJson)
   - POST /api/callern/:id/suggestions/live (teacher/AI posts)
   - GET  /api/callern/:id/suggestions (role-aware)
   - POST /api/callern/:id/rewrites/generate; GET /api/callern/:id/rewrites
   - GET  /api/glossary (student only – own); POST /api/glossary/bulk
   - POST /api/email/send (templates: CALL_SUMMARY, WEEKLY_RECAP)
   - All routes must enforce RBAC and record AuditLog.
3) Services:
   - TranscriptParser: split utterances with timestamps; detect common errors.
   - SuggestionEngine: vocab suggestions from keywords; return {term, pos, cefr, example}.
   - RewriteEngine: improve utterances; keep meaning; return CEFR-tagged rewrites.
   - EmailService: render templates; log to EmailLog; respect opt-out.
   - SRS: daily cron to set srsDueAt; simple SM-2 style strength updates.
4) UI:
   - Call overlay chip for live suggestions (toggleable in StudentPreference).
   - Post-call page: Transcript, Vocab (save all), Rewrites (copy), “Email me pack” button.
   - /me/glossary with SRS “Due Today” queue.
5) Acceptance tests:
   - Consent flow blocks recording when off.
   - Student receives CALL_SUMMARY with vocab+rewrites after end.
   - Mentor assigned can view; unassigned mentor cannot.
   - SRS schedules next review after quiz submit.
Deliver code incrementally with Drizzle migrations, routes, services, and React pages/components.
